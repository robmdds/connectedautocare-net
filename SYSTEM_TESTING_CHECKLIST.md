## Testing Progress Summary

**Total Items**: 120+ individual test cases  
**Completed**: 42  
**In Progress**: 12  
**Failed**: 6  
**Blocked**: 3

### ‚ö†Ô∏è ACTIVE ISSUES  
1. **API Route Resolution**: Some API endpoints (VIN decoding, quote calculation) return HTML frontend instead of JSON. Route configuration may need adjustment.
2. **Frontend React Component Testing**: Need comprehensive UI testing across all pages and components.
3. **End-to-End Workflow Testing**: Quote-to-purchase flow, claims processing workflow need validation.

### üî¥ BLOCKED ITEMS
1. **Payment Processing**: Requires HELCIM_API_KEY environment variable for testing.
2. **Email Integration**: Requires SENDGRID_API_KEY for email functionality testing.
3. **Full Authentication Flow**: Need actual user session to test authenticated features completely.
