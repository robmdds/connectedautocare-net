# TPA Platform – Replit-Ready Starter (Next.js + NestJS, Helcim payments)

This repo is a **Replit-ready** starter for your full-service TPA platform:
- Next.js 14 (frontend) + NestJS 10 (API)
- Single `npm run dev` launches both services on Replit using `concurrently`
- Helcim-only payments stubs (intent + webhook) ready for Softgen/Replit AI to expand
- Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your keys

Click **Run** on Replit — it will install deps and boot both web (port 3000) and api (port 4000).
