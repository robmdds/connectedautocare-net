1) Critical Fixes & Reliability Baseline
	1.	Public HTML Rendering
	•	Ensure a server‑rendered HTML shell (SSR/SSG) so non‑JS agents (search, link unfurlers, email scanners) get content.
	•	Add fallback <noscript> with core CTAs (Quote / Become a Reseller / Contact).
	2.	Robots + Sitemap
	•	/robots.txt with Sitemap: https://…/sitemap.xml.
	•	Autogenerate sitemap.xml for products, plan pages, FAQs, blog.
	3.	Canonical & Indexing Hygiene
	•	<link rel="canonical"> per route; prevent duplicate params from indexing.
	4.	Status Pages & Uptime
	•	Health endpoint /healthz; attach free uptime monitor + Slack/Email alert.
	5.	Security Headers
	•	HSTS, CSP (script-src with hashes), X‑Frame‑Options SAMEORIGIN, Referrer-Policy strict-origin-when-cross-origin.
